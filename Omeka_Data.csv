NOTES:
[1]. The information is from entry no. 5 in the 1889 catalogue of the Earl of Northbrook collection. It refers, most likely, to noted collector and dealer C. J. Nieuwenhuys [1799-1883], Brussels and London. 
[2]. As by Bernard Van Orley. 
[3]. In the 1889 catalogue of the Earl of Northbrook collection, this work, no. 5, is simply listed under the ""Early Netherlandish School"" section, with the following footnote: ""A similar picture was, in 1860, in the collection of the Rev. Mr. Heath, Vicar of Enfield."" 
[4]. The Earl lent it to the Royal Academy Exhibition of Flemish and Dutch art in 1927. 
[5]. Photo, no. R 770. Information from a copy of the firm's inventory records at the Getty Research Institute. The record for this painting lists the source as ""Sarasota N 248"", which may suggest a connection with John Ringling with whom the Böhler firm had a long and close relationship.
[6].

[1]. The location of this owner is recorded as Zoeterwoude, near Leyden. Leyden is the older Dutch spelling of the city of Leiden, which borders the municipality of Zoeterwoude. 
[2]. Sold for 15 fl. The date of the van Tol sale is from the Frick Art Reference Library Photoarchive and also from the provenance of another painting lot in the same sale, now at the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC. The sale date of June 15, 1772 given in the 1889 Northbrook collection catalogue is apparently in error. 
[3]. The seller is identified in the Getty Provenance Index as ""Merrem."" 
[4]. Purchased for 55 fl. 
[5]. Purchased for 10 fl. The purchaser Casparus Kopersmit, identified in the Getty Provenance Index, was married to Barend Kooy's daughter Alida Elisabeth Kooy. See curatorial file. 
[6]. Frick Photoarchive gives the purchaser's name asTijssen and records15 fl 50 as the purchase price. See copies of the Frick Library annotated sale catalague and of Frick Photoarchive record for the work. 
[7]. See 1889 catalogue of the Earl of Northbrook collection, no. 61. 
[8]. The painting was listed by a Duveen representative as hanging in the dining room of the Earl's London house in 1913.
[9]. See copies of Duveen correspondence (from the Getty Research Institute) in curatorial file regarding the sale of the Hals, still on panel, as part of a group of seven paintings.

[1] The painting was first noted to have been in the Palacio Nuevo in the 1885 catalogue of the collection of a later owner, Thomas G. Baring, 1st earl of Northbrook. The information was repeated in exhibition catalogues of 1899, 1938, and 1953.

[2] The literature on the Gallery's painting has always connected it to the painting in the De Jullienne and Horion sales. Jean Baptiste Descamps, La Vie des Peintres Flamands, Allemands et Hollandois, 4 vols., Paris, 1753-1763: 1(1753): 316, describes among three paintings by Rubens in De Jullienne's collection ""le belle Esquisse finie,"" which is possibly the depiction of Abraham and Melchizedek. There were, however, more than three Rubens paintings in De Jullienne's 1767 estate sale, including other sketches, so it is not certain that De Jullienne owned the painting in question as early as 1753, or even if it is the same painting. The dimensions of the painting listed in the 1767 and 1788 sale catalogues, given as 24 x 30 pouces and 24 x 30 1/2 pouces, respectively, are fairly close to those of the Gallery's painting. However, these dimensions are also close to several copies of this scene, among them the version in the John G. Johnson Collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In addition, the 1767 catalogue describes the painting as being on canvas and depicting Achimelec and David, and the 1788 entry says it had been engraved by Witdoock. The Gallery's painting is on panel, and the engraving by Witdoock is after an earlier Rubens painting of Abraham and Melchizedek now in the Musée Caen. Julia Armstrong-Totten of the Getty Provenance Index has kindly supplied the probable name of the buyer at the 1788 Horion sale, and the information that he was an auctioneer and dealer in Brussels. Max Rooses, L'Oeuvre de P.P. Rubens: Histoire et Description de ses Tableaux et Dessins, 5 vols., Antwerp, 1886-1892: 1(1886): 63, under no. 46, spells the name Looze. Despite these inconsistencies, assuming the painting in the 1767 and 1788 sales is the Gallery's, its provenance between 1788 and 1830 is not known with certainty. A complicating factor is that a number of paintings depicting Abraham and Melchizedek and attributed at the time to Rubens appeared in British sales in the early 19th century. The existence of several copies of the Gallery's painting, and the lack of descriptions and size information in the sales catalogues, makes identifying these paintings a challenge. Both Nora De Poorter, The Eucharist Series (Corpus Rubenianum Ludwi Burchard, Part 2), London and Philadelphia, 1978: 110, no. 7c, and Peter C. Sutton and Marjorie E. Wieseman, et al., The Age of Rubens, exh. cat., Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and Toledo [Ohio] Museum of Art, 1993: 271, no. 21, include in their provenance of the Gallery's painting the following sequence of ownership, and incorrectly identify the lot in the Dyson sale as no. 14: Simon M'Gillivray; (his sale, Christie's, London, 6-7 May 1825, 2nd day, no. 25); Dyson; (his sale, Christie's, London, 18 June 1825, no. 34); Crawford; Lady Stepney; (her sale, Christie's, London, 1 May 1830, no. 93, bought in). (The 1889 Northbrook catalogue entry for the Gallery's painting mentions the M'Gillivray and Dyson names and related sales in a note, but adds that these ""probably refer to another, or to other pictures."") Anneke Wertheim has further identified the painting from the 1830 Lady Stepney sale as lot 51 in the London sale of the collection of W.H. Trant, Esq. by Edward Foster on 9 and 11-12 June 1832. Further research has determined that the painting in the two 1825 sales could not be the same as the painting in the 1830 and 1832 sales, and that the latter (Stepney) painting could not be the one in the earlier 1767 and 1788 sales. The 1830 Lady Stepney sale catalogue states that the painting ""was formerly the property of John, Lord Trevor, and bought at the sale of his widow's effects in 1782,"" and this information is partially repeated in the 1832 Trant catalogue, where the entry reads ""Formerly the property of Lord Trevor, and bought at the sale of his effects in 1782,"" leaving out mention of his widow. Ann Davies, whose ancestor was housekeeper for the great-granddaughter of Catherine, Lady Stepney, has generously provided information about two Lady Stepneys, as well as Lord Trevor and his wife (correspondence of December 2004 and January 2005, in NGA curatorial files). John, Lord Trevor of Bromham, died in 1764, and his widow Elizabeth died 1 January 1782; therefore his ownership and his widow's 1782 sale (as yet unidentified, despite the kind efforts of Lynda McLeod, Librarian, Christie's Archive, London) conflict with the Jullienne/Horion ownership of between at least 1767 and 1788. Catherine, Lady Stepney (née Catherine Pollok) was born in 1778, and is therefore unlikely to be the buyer only four years later at Lady Trevor's sale. However, it is quite possible that the buyer in 1782 at the sale of either Lord Trevor's or his widow's effects was an earlier Lady Stepney. This was Elizabeth, Lady Stepney (née Elizabeth Lloyd) who was born in 1733, widowed in 1772, and whose younger son, Sir Thomas Stepney (1760-1825), inherited most of her property at her death in 1795. Sir Thomas succeeded his unmarried older brother, Sir John Stepney, as Baronet of Predergast in 1811, and in 1813 he married Catherine Pollok Manners after her divorce from her first husband, Russell Manners. A note in Christie's archive in London, kindly provided by Julia Armstrong-Totten, reads: ""Lady Stepney, consigns Rubens, Abraham and Melchisideck [sic] on June 4, 1812, delivered to Mr. Watson [Watson and Wheeler, undertakers], Bridge St. Westminster on Sept. 18."" Although there was technically no Lady Stepney alive in 1812, the consignor was likely Sir Thomas Stepney, disposing of some of the property he had inherited from his mother. The Getty Provenance Index could not locate the painting in an 1812 sale, so presumably it did not sell. When the painting appeared later in the ""Lady Stepney"" sale of 1830, the owner was probably Catherine, Lady Stepney, who had presumably inherited the painting after her husband's death in 1825. The auctioneer's copy of the 1830 sale catalogue confirms that the painting was bought in for 80 guineas. It is not known when Mr. Trant acquired the painting, but he may have had a financial arrangement with Lady Stepney, as nearly half of the unsold paintings from her 1830 sale appeared in the Trant sale two years later, seven of which she bought back. The Rubens was not one of them, and although none of the surviving copies of the 1832 catalogue indicate the buyer, the auctioneer's copy lists a price of £14.14. (Both auctioneer's catalogues are in the Library, Victoria and Albert Museum, London; correspondence from May 2004 and January 2005 with Julia Armstrong-Totten is in NGA curatorial files.) Since the painting listed in the 1830 and 1832 sales is the same, it cannot be the painting cited by Smith in 1830 (see note 3) as the one owned by Dowager Lady Stuart, which is securely documented as the Gallery's painting by virtue of its unbroken provenance from that date.

[3] The painting was first cited in the literature when it was identified in the collection of ""Dowager Lady Stuart"" by John Smith, A Catalogue Raisonné of the Works of the Most Eminent Dutch, Flemish and French Painters, 9 vols., London, 1829-1842: 2(1830):142, 184, no. 641.

(1799-1873),  c.1848 [3]; bequeathed to his nephew, Lord Northbrook, subsequently 1st Earl of Northbrook (1826-1904), in 1873; by descent to the 2nd Earl of Northbrook (1850-1929) until at least 1925? [4]; sold from Northbrook collection at an unkown date (see comment on next entry); sale, Sotheby and Co., London, July 16, 1930, no. 101 [5]. Lilienfeld Galleries, New York, NY, by January 1934; Howard A. Noble, Pittsburgh, PA, by 1939 [6]; his bequest to Museum, May 1964.

Notes:
[1]. In 1809, Lebrun published an engraving of the portrait as by Raphael (plate no. 40) as part of a collection formed during trips in 1807 and1808. 
[2].  Sir Thomas Baring likely acquired the painting through Mr. Harris, Bond Street, London who received many of the Lebrun pictures on consignment. See information on its early provenance and attribution in various sources, including W. Buchanan, ""Memoirs of Painting"", London, 1824 (p. 254, as by Raphael) and ""A Descriptive Catalogue of the Collection of Pictures Belonging to the Earl of Northbrook"", 1889, no. 211 (as by Andrea del Sarto). 
[3]. As stated in the Introduction of ""A Descriptive Catalogue of the Collection of Pictures Belonging to the Earl of Northbrook"", 1889: ""In 1848, on the death of Sir Thomas Baring, his collection was sold in accordance with his will; and the Italian, Spanish, and French pictures were bought at a valuation by Mr. Baring."" Waagen in Vol. 2 of ""Treaures"" published in 1854, describes the picture in Mr. Baring's collection and attributes it to Pontormo (p. 176).
[4]. Bernard Berenson attirbutes the picture to Franciabigio in 1896 and 1909 editions of ""Florentine Painters of the Renaissance"" and so does Venturi in ""Storia dell' Arte Italiana"" (1925, p. 452).  All three publications still refer to the painting as being in the Northbrook collection.
[5]. Listed and illustrated as by Raphael under section ""The Property of a Gentleman"" of the sale entitled ""Pictures and Drawings by Old Masters""; several other pictures in that section were also part of the Northbrook collection, so, perhaps, the ""Gentleman"" referred  to was the Earl himself (though he died in 1929) or someone else who bought a number of the pictures and resold them at this auction. Bought by Asscher for £500 (see copy of annotated catalogue from the Frick Library in the curatorial file).

[1] See Robert Raines, ""Watteau and 'Watteaus' in England before 1760,"" Gazette des Beaux-Arts 51 (February 1977): 62, for a discussion of which Beckford might have purchased the painting. William was his brother Richard's heir, and although William always resided in England, Richard lived mostly on the family's plantations in Jamaica. He only lived in London from late 1754 until late the next year, and he died in France early in 1756. If Richard owned the painting, it might possibly have been part of the ""useful and ornamental furnishings"" of his London house that were sold by his executors in April 1756 to Sir James Colebrooke, whose name is sometimes included in the provenance. See F.H.W. Sheppard, Survey of London, vol. 33, The Parish of St. Anne Soho, London, 1966: 89, for details about ownership of the house by Beckford and subsequent purchasers.

[2] Sometimes spelled ""Harene."" The title page of the 1764 sale catalogue clearly spells the name with a final ""c."" If this is the same Roger Harenc whose daughter, Susanna Mary Harenc, married Sir Archibald Edmonstone, 1st baronet Edmonstone, Harenc appears to have been born in Paris, came to England in the early 1720s, married an Englishwoman, and prospered in business. He is recorded as the buyer of Watteau paintings in sales in England in the 1740s and 1750s.

[3] Gustav Friedrich Waagen, Galleries and Cabinets of Art in Great Britain: Being an Account of More than Forty Collections of Paintings, Drawings, Sculptures, Mss., etc. etc. visited in 1854 and 1956, and now for the first time described, London, 1957: 96-97, records additions to the Baring collection since his visit in 1851.

[4] See Richard Kingzett of Agnew, letter to Colin Eisler, 21 November 1968, NGA curatorial files: ""[W]e bought the picture from the famous dealer, Wertheimer, in 1888 and sold it to Lord Iveagh in the same year. No provenance is given in our entry for the picture."" Later references identify the Wertheimer as Asher, rather than his brother Charles, who was also an art dealer.

[5] This information is in Wildenstein records, and was kindly shared with the NGA by Ay-Whang Hsia of Wildenstein via a copy of her 5 November 2008 e-mail to Katharine Baetjer (copy in NGA curatorial files). Colin Eisler (Paintings from the Samuel H. Kress Collection: European Schools Excluding Italian, Oxford, 1977: 304 and n. 48), on the basis of a remark in René Gimpel, Journal d'un collectionneur, marchand de tableaux, Paris, 1963: 275, assumed the painting was with Wildenstein in 1924. However, this was discounted by Joseph Baillio of Wildenstein, who instead interpreted the remark to indicate that Nathan Wildenstein was simply asking Gimpel for his help in acquiring the painting (see A Gift to America: Masterpieces of European Painting from the Samuel H. Kress Collection, Exh. cat. North Carolina Museum of Art; The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; The Seattle Art Museum; Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco; New York, 1994: 210 n. 3). The provenance supplied by Wildenstein to the Kress Foundation in 1942 (NGA curatorial files) incorrectly lists Walter Guinness and Lord Moyne as separate individuals and places the Thyssen-Bornemisza ownership between them, but it does not indicate the company had the painting more than once.

[6] The painting was in an exhibition of the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection that opened in July 1930. However, Wildenstein has no record of exactly when between February and July 1930 ownership of the painting changed hands (see Ay-Whang Hsia's e-mail of 5 November 2008; copy in NGA curatorial files).

[7] Wildenstein records provide the date by which the painting was with their New York office, and the sale date to the Kress Foundation (see Ay-Whang Hsia's e-mail of 5 November 2008; copy in NGA curatorial files).",None,None,None,None,The Italian Comedians,2015-12-30T14:54:34+00:00,None,False,1,files,http://northbrook.omeka.net/api/files?item=1719,1719,18,Museum Data,item_types,http://northbrook.omeka.net/api/item_types/18,2016-01-14T21:37:27+00:00,29003,users,http://northbrook.omeka.net/api/users/29003,True,"Antoine Watteau, NGA DC",http://northbrook.omeka.net/api/items/1719

[4] Everett Fahy (his letter of 19 November 1984 in NGA curatorial files) called attention to a Cooper negative of the painting in the Frick Art Reference Library in New York; the photograph, taken on the occasion of the sale in 1924 in London, shows the painting dirty and with a check running vertically through the figure, but otherwise with an aspect not unlike the present one.

[5] According to Evelyn Sandberg-Vavalà, ""Francesco Benaglio,"" Art in America 21 (1933): 62-63.

[6] By April 1948 (the date of Roberto Longhi's expertise, copy in NGA curatorial files), the panel must already have been with Contini-Bonacossi, for whom Longhi wrote his opinion in Italian (his expertises for the Kress Foundation are usually in English).

[7] The Kress Foundation made an offer to Contini-Bonacossi on 7 June 1948 for a group of twenty-eight paintings, including the Benaglio; the offer was accepted on 11 July 1948 (see copies of correspondence in NGA curatorial files).",None,None,None,None,Saint Jerome,2015-12-30T14:54:34+00:00,None,False,1,files,http://northbrook.omeka.net/api/files?item=1720,1720,18,Museum Data,item_types,http://northbrook.omeka.net/api/item_types/18,2016-03-03T21:57:19+00:00,29003,users,http://northbrook.omeka.net/api/users/29003,True,"Francesco Benaglio, NGA DC",http://northbrook.omeka.net/api/items/1720

Indeed, they were listed in the inventory composed on February 4, 1724, after the death of Henin’s wife, Angélique Boucot: “deux autres petits tableaux peints sur bois représentant des Espagnols & Espagnolette, dans leur bordure de bois doré, originaux de Watteau, prisé deux cens livres.” Henin survived his wife by only four months, dying on June 16, 1724.

Paris, collection of Jean de Jullienne (1686-1766). Julienne apparently bought this painting and its pendant, La Surprise, after the death of Nicolas Henin. Baron’s engraving, executed just before June 1730, states: “Tiré du Cabinet de Mr de Jullienne.” Jullienne sold L’Accord parfait and its pendant before the compiling of the 1756 illustrated catalogue of his collection, a manuscript now in the Morgan Library & Museum, New York.
   
Paris, collection of Germain Louis de Chauvelin (1685-1762; marquis de Grosbois, garde des sceaux, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs under Louis XV). His sale, Paris, June 21ff, 1762, lot 27: “Deux agréables Tableaux, peints sur bois, par Antoine Watteau; ils portent chacun 12 pouces de haut, sur 9 pouces de large. On les trouve gravés sous les titres de La Lorgneuse & de l’Accord parfait, le premier par Scotin, le second par Baron.“ According to an annotated copy of the catalogue in the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie, the pair of paintings sold together for 304.19 livres. Apparently at some point between 1730 and 1762 L’Accord parfait had been shorn of its original pendant of La Surprise and was paired instead with La Lorgneuse. The latter had originally been paired with Le Lorgneur. One wonders if this change was due to Jullienne or Chauvelin.

Paris, collection of Jean-Baptiste August II Le Rebours de Saint-Mard (1746-1793; président de la troisième Chambre des enquêtes). His sale, Paris, April 27ff, 1778, lot 31: “Antoine Watteau. Cinq figures de caractere, dont une femme qui tient un livre de musique, & un homme qui joue de la flûte traversiere dans un jardin.  Ce tableau agréable & dont la touche est facile, spirituelle & le coloris excellent, est peint sur bois; il porte 13 pouces de haut, sur 10 pouces de large.” Sold for 930.1 livres to “LeBrun Cadet” according to an annotated copy of the catalogue in the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie. The following lot (lot 32) was its faux pendant, La Lorgneuse.

Paris, collection of Jean Baptiste Lebrun (1748-1813, painter and art dealer). His sale, Paris, December 10-16, 1778, lot 109: “ANTOINE WATTEAU . . . Un Concert dans un jardin. Sur le devant est une jeune femme tenant un livre de musique: un jeune homme l’accompagne en jouant de la flûte: à ses pieds est un scapin vu par le dos. Plus loin sur le second plan est un autre personnage tenant une jeune fille par le bras.  Ce tableau qui est du meilleur tems de Watteau, doit être regardé comme un des chefs-d’œuvres de ce Peintre. Hauteur 13 pouces, largeur 10 pouces. T.“ According to an annotated copy of the catalogue in the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie, the painting sold for 1,300 livres. The collection was presented anonymously, but a copy of the catalogue in the Bibliothèque nationale de France has a penned notation on the title page: “app. à Lebrun.” The following lot was La Lorgneuse, although again it was not specifically designated as a pendant.

London, collection of Thomas Baring, Bart. (1772-1848). His sale, London, Christie’s, June 2-3, 1848, lot 84: “WATTEAU.  A CONCERT CHAMPÊTRE, a lady holding a music book for gentleman who is playing the flute, a young man lying at her feet; and two other figures in the background.” The picture sold for £152.5 to White, probably a dealer, according to an annotated copy of the catalogue in the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie. The following lot, described as ""the companion,"" was La Lorgneuse, but it was listed under the title of ""A Masquerade Champêtre."" The Rijksbureau’s copy of the catalogue is annotated “48 [for 84] & 85 Both Small landscapes.” 

London, collection of Andrew James (1793-c. 1857; London corn merchant); by descent to his widow Ann (b. 1788). While in her possession, the painting was seen by Waagen who described it and La Lorgneuse as “Two small but attractive pictures, with gentlemen and ladies in the open air. In one of them is a very pretty girl seen in profile, and a couple turning from the spectator.”

London, collection of Sarah Anne James (1829-c. 1891; daughter of Andrew and Ann James). Her sale and others, London, Christie’s, June 20, 1891, lot 33: “A. WATTEAU . . . L’ACCORD PARFAIT: a lady and gentleman seated under a tree near a statue, he is playing the flute from a music-book which lies open on her lap, at their feet is seated another gentleman, with his back to the spectator, behind them another lady and gentleman are walking away/ Panel, 14 in. by 11 in. / And the engraving by Baron / Exhibited at Burlington House, 1891.” Bought for £3,675 by Samson Wertheimer according to the annotated copy in the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie.

London, collection of Samson Wertheimer, (c. 1811-1892; art dealer). His sale, London, Christie’s, March 19, 1892, lot 708: “A. WATTEAU . . . L’ACCORD PARFAIT: a lady and gentleman seated under a tree near a statue, he is playing the flute from a music-book, which lies open on her lap; at their feet is seated another gentleman, with his back to the spectator; behind them another lady and gentleman are walking away / 14 in. by 11 in.; and the engraving by Baron / Exhibited at Burlington House, 1891 / From Miss James’s Collection.” It was bought by the London dealer Thomas Agnew & Sons for £3,500 according to an annotated copy in the Bibliothèque nationale. An annotated copy of the catalogue in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, lists the price at £2,205. The latter figure may prove more accurate. Almost immediately after the sale, Boucaud noted that the price of the painting had dropped dramatically. According to him, Wertheimer had bought the painting for 92,000 francs and then, just a few months later, he sold it for merely 52,500 francs.

Hampstead (London), Kenwood House, collection of Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh (1847-1927, brewer). The painting was bought from Agnew in 1892 and presumably remained with the family at Kenwood until it was sold in 1998. Yet a letter of March 1, 1983, from the Earl of Iveagh to John Jacob at the Iveagh Bequest, Kenwood, states that he did not know where the painting was. The picture was sold to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art via the London-based dealer Simon Dickinson in 1998 for approximately £4,000,000.",None,None,None,None,L'Accord Parfait,2016-03-11T19:58:03+00:00,None,False,1,files,http://northbrook.omeka.net/api/files?item=1755,1755,18,Museum Data,item_types,http://northbrook.omeka.net/api/item_types/18,2016-03-11T19:58:03+00:00,29003,users,http://northbrook.omeka.net/api/users/29003,True,"Antoine Watteau, LACMA",http://northbrook.omeka.net/api/items/1755
